# ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Promance â€“ AI-Powered Prompt Enhancer  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
**Promance** is an AI-powered web application designed to improve and refine prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It helps users transform vague or unstructured prompts into optimized, well-structured ones that yield better, more accurate, and context-aware responses.  

The project explores advanced prompt engineering techniques such as zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. By integrating intelligent suggestions, real-time feedback, and context enrichment, **Promance** enables users to craft high-quality prompts that maximize the effectiveness of AI models.  

## ðŸ”§ Features  
- **Prompt Optimization** â€“ Enhances clarity, specificity, and structure of user prompts.  
- **Multiple Prompting Modes** â€“ Supports zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques.  
- **Real-time Suggestions** â€“ Provides alternative rephrasings and improvements for better results.  
- **Contextual Enrichment** â€“ Uses embeddings and vector databases to add relevant context.  
- **Evaluation Pipeline** â€“ Tests improved prompts against sample queries for measurable performance.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Clean and interactive web app for easy experimentation.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Next.js / React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python  
- **LLM**: OpenAI / Hugging Face API  
- **Database**: Vector DB (Pinecone / FAISS)  
- **Evaluation**: Custom metrics to compare original vs. improved prompts  

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Scope  
- Multi-language prompt support  
- Prompt version history & analytics  
- Integration with chatbots and AI tools  
- Collaboration features for team-based prompt engineering 

### Zero Shot Prompting 

  A zero shot prompting means giving a task of AI without providing examples or other information , it relies the pre-trained model to respond to your question
