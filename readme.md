# ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Promance â€“ AI-Powered Prompt Enhancer  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
**Promance** is an AI-powered web application designed to improve and refine prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It helps users transform vague or unstructured prompts into optimized, well-structured ones that yield better, more accurate, and context-aware responses.  

The project explores advanced prompt engineering techniques such as zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. By integrating intelligent suggestions, real-time feedback, and context enrichment, **Promance** enables users to craft high-quality prompts that maximize the effectiveness of AI models.  

## ðŸ”§ Features  
- **Prompt Optimization** â€“ Enhances clarity, specificity, and structure of user prompts.  
- **Multiple Prompting Modes** â€“ Supports zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques.  
- **Real-time Suggestions** â€“ Provides alternative rephrasings and improvements for better results.  
- **Contextual Enrichment** â€“ Uses embeddings and vector databases to add relevant context.  
- **Evaluation Pipeline** â€“ Tests improved prompts against sample queries for measurable performance.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Clean and interactive web app for easy experimentation.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Next.js / React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python  
- **LLM**: OpenAI / Hugging Face API  
- **Database**: Vector DB (Pinecone / FAISS)  
- **Evaluation**: Custom metrics to compare original vs. improved prompts  

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Scope  
- Multi-language prompt support  
- Prompt version history & analytics  
- Integration with chatbots and AI tools  
- Collaboration features for team-based prompt engineering

## Prompting 


### Zero Shot Prompting 

  A zero shot prompting means giving a task of AI without providing examples or other information , it relies the pre-trained model to respond to your question

 * Translate "What is your name ?" in Russian - Text Transformation
 * How is the weather today in Delhi - Information Retrival 
 * Write a poem on nature - Creative Task
 * What is the answer to 147^89 ? - Reason & Problem Solving

 ### One Shot Prompting

One shot prompting means giving one example of task to AI in your prompt before asking it to perform the same task on a new input.

## 1) Sentiment Classification

* **Input-1:** This is some good food
* **Output-1:** Positive

Now classify:

* **Input-2:** The food didn't have the warmth
* **Output-2:** [To be completed by AI]

## 2) Summarization

* **Text:** "The sun rises in the east and sets in the west."
* **Summary:** "Sun moves east to west."

Now summarize:

* **Text:** "Water boils at 100Â°C under standard atmospheric pressure."
* **Summary:** [To be completed by AI]

## 3) Reasoning

* **Problem:** 12 + 8 = ?
* **Answer:** 20

Now solve:

* **Problem:** 25 - 9 = ?
* **Answer:** [To be completed by AI]

# ðŸ§  Multi-Shot (Few-Shot) Prompting

## ðŸ”¹ What is Multi-Shot Prompting?
Multi-shot prompting (also called *few-shot prompting*) is when you provide the AI **multiple examples** of a task before asking it to complete a new one.  

Itâ€™s like a teacher showing several solved problems on the board so the student can recognize the pattern before solving their own.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Multi-Shot Works
- The AI doesnâ€™t just rely on abstract instructions.  
- It **learns from patterns** in multiple examples.  
- It reduces mistakes in tasks where one example isnâ€™t enough.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Structure
1. **Task instruction** â€“ Tell the AI what to do.  
2. **Multiple examples** â€“ Show the pattern (input â†’ output).  
3. **New input** â€“ The actual task to solve.

# âš¡ Dynamic Prompting

## ðŸ”¹ What is Dynamic Prompting?  
Dynamic prompting means **building or adjusting prompts automatically** (often with code) depending on the **context, user input, or external data**.  

Instead of writing one static prompt, you make it **flexible and reusable**, so the AI can adapt to different situations.  

Itâ€™s commonly used in chatbots, apps, or automation systems where prompts must change **dynamically** at runtime.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use Dynamic Prompting?  
- âœ… **Personalization** â†’ Prompts can include user-specific details.  
- âœ… **Context-awareness** â†’ Adjusts based on history, database, or environment.  
- âœ… **Automation** â†’ Saves time by generating prompts programmatically.  
- âœ… **Scalability** â†’ Works across multiple use cases without manually writing every prompt.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Examples of Dynamic Prompting  

### 1. Personalization (User-Specific)  
```python
user_name = "Chaitanya"
task = "summarize this article in 3 bullet points"

prompt = f"Hello {user_name}, please {task}."
print(prompt)
